              Senior Software Engineer

        <p>
          <i>Skills:</i> Agile environment, .NET, SQL Server, Continuous integration
          using Jenkins, JIRA, Angular.js, Knockout.js, Dojo, GIS
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Role:</i> As a Senior Engineer I architected and lead many projects. Normally,
          I worked with one or two additional developers delegating tasks and collecting 
          requirements. Most of these projects were made for internal customers to the city,
          but there are some public facing apps that either required a rewrite, like the 
          <a href="http://eservices.scottsdaleaz.gov/maps/" target="_blank">public maps</a>, 
          or ongoing maintenance like the city's 
          <a href="https://eservices.scottsdaleaz.gov/eservices/" target="_blank">eServices</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Challenges:</i> Moving into a senior role was a new challenge for me as I would be
          more in charge of making sure projects get completed. I learned leadership skills through
          time and have been recognized many times in the organization. In addition, working on the City's
          public maps gave me a chance to learn mapping and GIS and how it translates to development.

          <i>Role:</i> I was tasked with handling smaller projects solo. I had to gather requirements
          and provide ongoing maintenance for those. These ranged from simple, static websites,
          all the way to automating the finishing process at a steel mill. This range of projects
          enabled me to keep my knowledge fresh.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Challenges:</i> Being that this was the first time I stepping into a professional
          development role, I had quite a bit of learning to do. This fueled my desire to keep learning and try to become
          the best I can. Also, adminstrating production servers and a brand new phone system was a huge 
          challenge that I was asked to overcome in order to help the company.

          site was used by various city governments and companies for pulling aggregated Census
          data to use in planning and construction. I pulled in large datasets into
          MySQL and building the site to aggregate and display it.

            </strong>
            <p>
              Upon finishing the new public maps for the City, the CIO when around
              championing it as a new way Scottsdale was making data easier for the
              citizens to access and understand. It was submitted to the AGIC 
              (Arizona Geographic Information Council) Symposium they held in 2013.
              The project walked away with that award.

              In addition to the ACT, Illinois has its own test given during the same timeframe. While
              also being a review of how the school district is doing, but it also is another test of
              a student's knowledge. I received this award on the Science portion of the test. No direct
              score is given but it is awarded for excellent performance in a particular area.
